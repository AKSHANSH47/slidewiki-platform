                <p>Decks and slides in SlideWiki are published under the Creative Common Attribution ShareAlike licence. This license lets others reuse, alter and build on slides work as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. All new slides or works outside of SlideWiki based on your work will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use but will need to attribute your work and publish under the same license.</p>

   <h3 className="ui header">Why do we use the CC BY-SA licence for SlideWiki decks and Slides?</h3>             
                    <p>The CC BY-SA license is used by Wikipedia and similar resources, which means you can include material from Wikipedia in your decks as long as you include the original source. It also ensures that material created by our users is always attributed to them, which we believe enhances the quality and probity of educational resources. </p>
                <p>By using this license, other users will be free to copy and redistribute the materials in your deck in any medium or format. They will also be able to adapt the materials, including remixing, transforming and building on the material for any purpose, including commercial activities. </p>
      <h3 className="ui header">Can I add any materials to my slides and decks under the CC BY-SA licence?</h3>      
                <p>When adding content to your slides, it is your responsibility to ensure that it can be shared under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license.

      <h3 className="ui header">Where can I find material that I can use under this license in my Slides and decks?</h3>
                <p>As all decks and slides are published under a license that allows content to be adapted and resused, you can reuse content from any decks in your own slides. The Append Deck and Append Slides function allows you to find and attach slides and decks as you are creating you are authoring your own work.</p>

However, it is your responsibility to ensure that you provide credit or attribution to the creator within the image upload dialog.</p>
                <p> If a video or content has an Embed function provided by the video’s owner then it is possible to embed the video in your slides. However, caution should be taken with videos that could have been posted without the copyright owner’s permission and you should not copy the video, only allow videos to stream through embedding it in a slide.
